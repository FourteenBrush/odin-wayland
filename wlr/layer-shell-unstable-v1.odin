        A positive value is only meaningful if the surface is anchored to one
        edge or an edge and both perpendicular edges. If the surface is not
        anchored, anchored to only two perpendicular edges (a corner), anchored
        to only two parallel edges or anchored to all edges, a positive value
        will be treated the same as zero.

        A positive zone is the distance from the edge in surface-local
        coordinates to consider exclusive.

        Surfaces that do not wish to have an exclusive zone may instead specify
        how they should interact with surfaces that do. If set to zero, the

        indicates that it would not like to be moved to accommodate for other
        surfaces, and the compositor should extend it all the way to the edges
        it is anchored to.

        For example, a panel might set its exclusive zone to 10, so that
        maximized shell surfaces are not shown on top of it. A notification
        might set its exclusive zone to 0, so that it is moved to avoid
        occluding the panel, but shell surfaces are shown underneath it. A
        wallpaper or lock screen might set their exclusive zone to -1, so that
        they stretch below or over the panel.
